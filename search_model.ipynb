      "[{'Content': '11.4.2.5 data analysis data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: simulation. quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks  and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. simulations  are typically performed using a monte carlo analysis. when running a monte carlo analysis for cost risk, the  simulation uses the project cost estimates. when running a monte carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule  network diagram and duration estimates are used. an integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses  both inputs. the output is a quantitative risk analysis model. computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times. the input  values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random  for each iteration. outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g., project end date,  project cost at completion). typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a  particular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (s-curve) representing  the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. an example s-curve from a monte carlo cost risk  analysis is shown in figure 11-13. figure 11-13. example s-curve from quantitative cost risk analysis 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 $2.0m 23% chance of meeting target target $2.2m expected value $2.35m 85% chance of costing $2.45m or less $2.1m $2.2m $2.3m $2.4m $2.5m $2.6m $2.7m $2.8m predicted total project cost cumulative probability (%) cumulative probability (%) range of uncertainty not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 434  part 1 - guide for a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which  elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. a criticality index is calculated for  each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path  during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. the output from a criticality analysis allows the project  team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall  schedule performance of the project. sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of  uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. it correlates variations in project outcomes with  variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model. one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated correlation  coefﬁcient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can inﬂuence the project outcome.  this can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or speciﬁc sources  of ambiguity. items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.   an example tornado diagram is shown in figure 11-14. figure 11-14. example tornado diagram activity or risk driving projection duration correlation with project duration -0.2          -0.1          0             0.1           0.2           0.3          0.4           0.5 activity b12.3  manufacture reactors risk 5.2  dcs may fail installation test risk 5.7  duplicate test may not be required activity a3.12  construct control room risk 4.6  piling contractor may deliver early activity a7.1  provide temporary facilities activity d1.9  install equipment risk 7.2  hydrotest may find fewer faults not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 435 decision tree analysis. decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of  action. alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different  decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both  threats and opportunities). the end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following  that particular path, which can be negative or positive. the decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal  path to be selected. an example decision tree is shown in figure 11-15. figure 11-15. example decision tree computed:  payoffs minus costs  along path decision definition decision node chance node net path value decision to  be made input: cost of each decision  output: decision made input: scenario probability,  reward if it occurs output: expected monetary  value (emv)  build or upgrade?

(this choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible  outcome of a loss of $30m). decision node chance node end of branch strong demand ($200m) weak demand ($90m) strong demand ($120m) weak demand ($60m) build new plant (invest $120m) upgrade plant (invest $50m) not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 436  part 1 - guide influence diagrams. inﬂuence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. an inﬂuence  diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and inﬂuences, together  with the relationships and effects between them. where an element in the inﬂuence diagram is uncertain as a  result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the  inﬂuence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. the inﬂuence diagram is then evaluated using a  simulation technique, such as monte carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest inﬂuence  on key outcomes. outputs from an inﬂuence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods,  including s-curves and tornado diagrams.

      "[{'Content': '11.5.2.4 strategies for threats five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows: escalate. escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside  the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. escalated  risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the  project level. the project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the threat and communicates the  details to that person or part of the organization. it is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted  by the relevant party in the organization. threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives  that would be affected if the threat occurred. escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after  escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information. not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 443 avoid. risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its  impact. it may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative  impact. avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective  that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. the  risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur.  examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the  project strategy, or reducing scope. some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information,  improving communication, or acquiring expertise. transfer. transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the  impact if the threat occurs. risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the  threat. transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance,  performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for  speciﬁed risks to another party. mitigate. in risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. early  mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. adopting  less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation  actions. mitigation may involve prototype development (see section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from  a bench-scale model of a process or product. where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response  might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. for example, designing redundancy into a  system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component. accept. risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. this strategy  may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective  to address a threat in any other way. acceptance can be either active or passive. the most common active  acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to  handle the threat if it occurs. passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the  threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly. not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 444  part 1 - guide '}]\n"

(this choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible  outcome of a loss of $30m). decision node chance node end of branch strong demand ($200m) weak demand ($90m) strong demand ($120m) weak demand ($60m) build new plant (invest $120m) upgrade plant (invest $50m) not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 436  part 1 - guide influence diagrams. inﬂuence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. an inﬂuence  diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and inﬂuences, together  with the relationships and effects between them. where an element in the inﬂuence diagram is uncertain as a  result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the  inﬂuence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. the inﬂuence diagram is then evaluated using a  simulation technique, such as monte carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest inﬂuence  on key outcomes. outputs from an inﬂuence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods,  including s-curves and tornado diagrams.

       "'11.4.2.5 data analysis data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: simulation. quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks  and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. simulations  are typically performed using a monte carlo analysis. when running a monte carlo analysis for cost risk, the  simulation uses the project cost estimates. when running a monte carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule  network diagram and duration estimates are used. an integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses  both inputs. the output is a quantitative risk analysis model. computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times. the input  values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random  for each iteration. outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g., project end date,  project cost at completion). typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a  particular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (s-curve) representing  the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. an example s-curve from a monte carlo cost risk  analysis is shown in figure 11-13. figure 11-13. example s-curve from quantitative cost risk analysis 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 $2.0m 23% chance of meeting target target $2.2m expected value $2.35m 85% chance of costing $2.45m or less $2.1m $2.2m $2.3m $2.4m $2.5m $2.6m $2.7m $2.8m predicted total project cost cumulative probability (%) cumulative probability (%) range of uncertainty not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 434  part 1 - guide for a quantitative schedule risk analysis, it is also possible to conduct a criticality analysis that determines which  elements of the risk model have the greatest effect on the project critical path. a criticality index is calculated for  each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path  during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. the output from a criticality analysis allows the project  team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall  schedule performance of the project. sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of  uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. it correlates variations in project outcomes with  variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model. one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated correlation  coefﬁcient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can inﬂuence the project outcome.  this can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or speciﬁc sources  of ambiguity. items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.   an example tornado diagram is shown in figure 11-14. figure 11-14. example tornado diagram activity or risk driving projection duration correlation with project duration -0.2          -0.1          0             0.1           0.2           0.3          0.4           0.5 activity b12.3  manufacture reactors risk 5.2  dcs may fail installation test risk 5.7  duplicate test may not be required activity a3.12  construct control room risk 4.6  piling contractor may deliver early activity a7.1  provide temporary facilities activity d1.9  install equipment risk 7.2  hydrotest may find fewer faults not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 435 decision tree analysis. decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of  action. alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different  decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks (including both  threats and opportunities). the end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following  that particular path, which can be negative or positive. the decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing the optimal  path to be selected. an example decision tree is shown in figure 11-15. figure 11-15. example decision tree computed:  payoffs minus costs  along path decision definition decision node chance node net path value decision to  be made input: cost of each decision  output: decision made input: scenario probability,  reward if it occurs output: expected monetary  value (emv)  build or upgrade?

(this choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible  outcome of a loss of $30m). decision node chance node end of branch strong demand ($200m) weak demand ($90m) strong demand ($120m) weak demand ($60m) build new plant (invest $120m) upgrade plant (invest $50m) not for distribution, sale or reproduction. 436  part 1 - guide influence diagrams. inﬂuence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. an inﬂuence  diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and inﬂuences, together  with the relationships and effects between them. where an element in the inﬂuence diagram is uncertain as a  result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the  inﬂuence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. the inﬂuence diagram is then evaluated using a  simulation technique, such as monte carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest inﬂuence  on key outcomes. outputs from an inﬂuence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods,  including s-curves and tornado diagrams.
