      "impact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative \n",
      "impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective \n",

      "risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur. \n",

      "mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting \n",
      "less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation \n",
      "actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from \n",
      "a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response \n",
      "might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a \n",

      "manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant \n",

      "u\n",

      "ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the beneﬁt associated with a particular \n",
      "opportunity by ensuring that it deﬁnitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of \n",

      "the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.\n",
      "u\n",
      "u Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the \n",
      "beneﬁt if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they \n",
      "are best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a \n",
